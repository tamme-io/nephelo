# nephelo
A Cloud Formation library to more easily create AWS Infrastructure programatically. Nephelo, short for Nephelococcygia, is the art of watching clouds.

This is under construction, and though it has successfully deployed a multi region application, it is some of the worst code written.
There is no documentation, there is no error handling, there are no warranties, guarantees or even tests.

In fact, it would seem unwise to use this library at all in it's current form.

#### WARNING ####

This library is under construction, under no circumstances should you use it in a production environment.
